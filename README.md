# Bayesian-Analysis-and-Inference
#### Stamatics IIT Kanpur Project

#### Objective 
• To build probabilistic programming models using Bayesian Statistics to capture complex relations in data
#### Approach
• Utilized ArviZ for effective posterior visualization, predictive checks and for diagnostics of Bayesian models
• Utilized PyMC3 for hierarchical models, expanded linear regression analysis techniques on complex data
• Explored model averaging, modeling using Bambi, and interoperability with variable selection techniques
