# Bayesian-Analysis-and-Inference
#### Stamatics IIT Kanpur Project
#### Objective 
• To build probabilistic programming models using Bayesian Statistics to capture complex relations in data
#### Approach
• Utilized ArviZ for effective posterior visualization, predictive checks and for diagnostics of Bayesian models
• Utilized PyMC3 for hierarchical models, expanded linear regression analysis techniques on complex data

Developed various Bayesian models using PyMC by probabilistic programming, incorporating Monte Carlo simulations, variational inference, and trace-based diagnostics and visualizations via ArviZ for enhanced model interpretability

Utilized Gaussian distributions, Student’s t-distributions, and hierarchical models for robust handling of outliers and limited data. Incorporated MAP estimation and posterior predictive checks to validate models. Tools included Aesara backend, NumPy, Matplotlib, and ArviZ for computation & visualization

Implemented trace plots, pair plots, and credible intervals for uncertainty quantification and model validation. Addressed real-world problems, including water quality analysis, parameter estimation in ODEs, and linear regression, ensuring accuracy through hyperprior-based shrinkage and advanced statistical techniques.
